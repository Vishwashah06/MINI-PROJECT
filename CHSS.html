<h2>EDUCATION TO INNOVATION</h2>
<h3>COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE</h3>
<p> 
Silver Oak College of Humanities and Social Science (SOCHSS) was established in the year 2019. Silver Oak University (SOU) has made an attempt to look forward for bridging the gap between the academic degree and the corporate industry requirements and enable students to achieve excellence in every aspect of life.. The Bachelor of Arts programme with a variety of subject combinations gives to our students the best opportunities for learning through curricular as well as extra-curricular activities. The objective is to impart theoretical knowledge blended with practical experience. We guide and encourage our students to gain a professional touch
Language is one of the most powerful communication tools available to an individual. With globalization, professionals having proficiency in more than one language are career-wise, on an advantageous position.
Master of Arts programme is a 2-year postgraduate exhaustive course. It gives students an in-depth knowledge of the various subjects of arts and humanities. This programme offers a number of diverse benefits ranging from enhanced career prospects to improved problem-solving and decision-making skills. Students' valuable transferable skills such as critical thinking, research skills and time management will be in demand in many areas of business. It lays an excellent foundation for further study or research at doctoral level, as well as a respected qualification in its own right.
We provide students with an immersive, collaborative, and inspiring environment where they can develop a broadly informed, highly disciplined intellect that will help them be successful in whatever work they finally choose. Our students graduate with the values and knowledge they need to pursue meaningful work, find passion in life-long learning, and lead successful and purposeful lives.
We encourage our students to explore the academic landscapes, venturing into unfamiliar fields of knowledge and perhaps, discovering new passion that will take them in a different direction altogether. Along the way, faculty members help guide them, and fellow students offer diverse perspectives that can shed new light on the path.
With the motive to nurture students, we tap the spirit of inquiry and prepare them to become global citizens
Program Objectives:
Students should learn to engage with texts and works of arts by learning and practicing methods of close reading, careful analysis and critical thinking.
Students should learn to examine how individual works of the humanities have been shaped by their historical and cultural contexts, and how works of the humanities in turn have influenced the values, beliefs, institutions and actions of their audiences. Students should study examples of cultural interaction, diffusion and change both in the past and in the modern period.
Students should acquire a substantial knowledge of philosophical, literary, aesthetic and religious movements in the Western traditions. They also should acquire some knowledge of works of the humanities, or specifically of religious traditions, and of cultural history in at least one non-Western culture
Students should learn and practice methods of inquiry used in academic disciplines of the humanities, the history of culture, or the academic study of religion. The department should support the study of methodological issues in non-Western intellectual traditions, and critical thinking about choices of methods and their implicit and explicit assumptions
Program Outcomes:
Apply analytical skills to social phenomena in order to understand human behavior.
Apply knowledge and experience to foster personal growth and better appreciate the diverse social world in which we live.
Understand the role of individuals and institutions within the context of society.
Assess different social science theories and concepts and understand the distinction between empirical and other methods of inquiry.
